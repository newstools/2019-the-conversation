Astronomy is truly fascinating. Just how captivating is apparent from the work being done at the South African Astronomical Observatory in Cape Town. As the national centre for optical and infrared astronomy in South Africa, the observatory is responsible for ground breaking astronomical work in the region. Scientists and researchers work closely with colleagues based at SALT, the giant telescopes that have been built 200 kms up the coast. As part of a  global network, they are doing pioneering research into astronomy and astrophysics. This week’s guest, astronomer Dr Itumeleng Monageng, shares some insights.
