Unemployment is a major problem in South Africa. The youth – defined as those aged between 15 and 35 – make up a big proportion of the country’s high unemployment rate. The agricultural sector could be a key source of job creation for these young people. But while some in this group are interested in agriculture, there are obstacles in their path. And that means many young South Africans are turning their backs on the sector. In today’s episode of Pasha Luke Metelerkamp, a post-doctoral research fellow at Rhodes University, discusses how South Africa’s youth feel about agriculture as a possible space for jobs. Photo:
