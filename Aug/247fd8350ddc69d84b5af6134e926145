There’s a branch of physics called quantum mechanics, which deals with probabilities and makes a principle out of uncertainty. It tries to understand interesting phenomena that normal physics can’t and can be applied in a number of ways, including to quantum machine learning. Sound like science fiction? It’s not. In today’s episode of Pasha Professor Francesco Petruccione and researcher Amira Abbas from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa take us through what quantum machine learning is and how it can be useful in the real world.
